# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a CV management project currently in early development stages. The repository contains minimal structure with only basic documentation files.

## Current State

The repository is in initial setup phase with:
- Basic README describing it as a "cv management project"
- Standard LICENSE file
- No build system or dependencies configured yet

## Development Notes

This project appears to be at the beginning of development. Future development will likely require:
- Choosing and setting up a technology stack
- Adding build/dependency management configuration
- Establishing code architecture

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project structure and development workflow are established.
